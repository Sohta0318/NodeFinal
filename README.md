This application is for managing expenses.
You can add the data of incomes and spendings and edit them.
On the home page, you can check how much do you still have after you get the income and spend money this month.
the most difficult part was create relations on Mongoose. I'm not used to MongoDB that much, so it takes quite few hours to get it done.
